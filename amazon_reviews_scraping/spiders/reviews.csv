  I absolutely loved the concept of the Nintendo Switch and decided to get one due to its popular demand. It’s pretty awesome and best to get it at the normal price of $299.99 because it really isn’t worth $300.00+ and it really refreshes the gaming atmosphere. However, handheld mode is so enormous that it’s a little uncomfortable. I was on the fence about buying this or the Nintendo Switch Lite, because I rarely have anyone else around to play some really cool multiplayer games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or Super Smash Bros. Plus, the Switch Lite doesn’t come with controller/joy con problems and is smaller, more comfortable, and accessible. One other thing that stands out on the Lite is it has a smaller screen but games look a bit sharper on it. That said, some of the free games are pretty addictive! I think it was totally worth the $300.00, but it does cost $20 to buy Nintendo Online to play any Nintendo game’s online player. I also wouldn’t recommend buying a Pro controller because the joy con controller is pretty comfortable, so far. If you’re someone who loves hanging around friends and family, get the regular Switch. If you’re a solo and lone wolf type of badass, get the Switch Lite!

  Love my new Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing version. I have been waiting for over a year for this. I originally ordered the regular version but it never came so I went to reorder and found that this was finally available. So glad I finally got it. After a year I would have taken anything...my luck - this one was available. So easy to set up. So easy to use. So very happy with the Amazon customer service and the Nintendo Switch. Don’t buy from scalpers who buy cheap and jack up the price. Just wait patiently. Worth the wait.

  Spent a lot of time looking to find a switch that wasn’t overpriced, and after doing lots of refreshing and looking at stock informer sites, I was finally able to purchase one. Is in perfect condition, brand new, and delivered on time! Definitely worth the wait of getting it at standard pricing, now to spend countless hours playing ACNH!

  Wonderful product. There are many minor hiccups that I already knew of before purchasing this product e.g. joycon drift, shakey joycons, hot while docked, online connectivity, dock scratch, etc. However, most of these risks i knew well ahead of time and so I was not bothered by them as most already have a diy fix for them as discovered by the Switch community. Great product, do some research before purchasing one, Nintendo methodology in developing their products can be a little strange at times but the good outweighs the bad with this product.

  After owning the original Wii for years and enjoying it with 0 problems I decided on getting the Switch, even though I mainly play my games on PC now a days, I thought it would be a great console for my wife and I to come together every now and then to play. I was lucky to score one when Nintendo finally got it back in stock after months of no stock because of the pandemic. The first day I got it the right (red) joy con kept disconnecting every 5-10 minutes. I was literally 5 feet away from the console with line of sight. After going through the troubleshooting steps of disconnecting joy cons and updating the console OS and controller firmware, it still had the same problem. The left (blue) joy con worked flawlessly. I searched online and found hundreds if not thousands of posts about people experiencing disconnecting joy cons and various work-arounds. Some even claimed that by having your foot propped up in front of the line of sight would cause all sorts of controller issues including lag and disconnects. So I did my long hours of testing, purchasing new official joy cons, and 3rd parties and am discouraged by my findings.Ultimately I found that the built-in bluetooth radio in the switch is just not powerful enough. Considering the amount of posts regarding controller pairing and disconnects issues, I would say the problem has been known for a long time. And instead of Nintendo recalling or replacing their poorly designed consoles they blame the environment or user error. They state things like ""make sure your console is away from wireless devices of any kind"". Seriously? Everyone has 20 wireless devices in their house from cell phones, routers, modems, smart TV's, wireless speakers, smart hubs, Alexa devices, the list goes on. Nintendo even states to keep the Switch away from fish tanks. Really? Soon they'll be saying to keep the switch away from air and light.I contacted Nintendo within the first week I got the Switch after getting fed up with dying because of constant controller lag and disconnects. Tier 1 support is a joke. They just want you to send it in which customer pays for shipping, and I may get my console back in 30 days. So after back and forth discussion with Tier 1 support I finally found that there is an escalation line which they forwarded me to which seems to be a line of seniors or assistant managers. Again they wanted me to send in the console. I called BS and explained that the console was only a week old. We finally agreed that I would temporarily pay for a replacement right joy con, and only after they received my defective right joy con that I would get reimbursed. New right joy con came, had the same problems albeit it was less noticeable, less disconnects. I sent my old one to them and it took them 30 days to refund my money which was $50 because they had to inspect the controller for any damage or mods. Seriously? I eventually got my money back but what a pain.Fast forward about a month and lag and disconnects are still happening. I purchased a brand new official joy con from Amazon and even though it hasn't outright disconnected it has shown lag issues again, sitting 5 feet away from the console and with direct line of sight. I even started unplugging wireless devices like my wireless speaker, just to see if anything would increase the controllers range and reliability and nothing helped.At the end of the day the Nintendo Switch is riddled with controller issues and I am not even getting into the whole ""drifting"" problem that people are suing Nintendo over. Now a days it seems that companies just release untested unreliable electronics, even the all and might Nintendo company, and don't take responsibility for it. A player needs reliable controllers to play a consoles content AKA joy con controllers for the Nintendo Switch, like a player needs a reliable mouse and keyboard for playing PC games. And for the price tag of an official Nintendo Switch joy con set at around $70 I expect them to be flawless, and their from from it. And this console isn't even new. It's been out for several years and Nintendo has had plenty of time to fix their issues, and they have chosen to blame us, the consumers instead of taking ownership of the problem.I plan to exchange the Switch for another using the Amazon exchange policy. Luckily, my purchase qualified for the holiday return policy so I have until February 1st to return it. If the new one acts up the same way I will be returning it and will be calling my credit card company to reimburse the 4 games I purchased from the Switch store since the Nintendo store has a no refund policy, which is a complete joke and such a policy should be discouraged.

  On paper this is such a slick device, and combined with great Nintendo titles this was something I was excited for. BUT this system just isn't there yet. Right now I'm dealing with input lag that goes beyond controller or title specific issues. Right from the get go, setting it up (while in portable mode) felt odd. The touch screen and the attached joy-cons felt a bit slow. The input lag was the same speed as my PS4 with my TVs game mode OFF. Not a huge deal for many who will play most casual games, but annoying enough for me that titles like Cuphead and Enter the Gungeon are hindered. I do wonder if the newer portable only version doesn't have these issues, but I'm mainly interested in this as a home console.And it's online component? They still haven't caught up with Xbox Live from the 360 generation. Not a huge problem with Discord around, but still.Lot's of pluses for this system for sure, but this is mainly a message to people to try out the system first and decide for yourself if the input lag is bad enough to ruin your experience. A lot of people are very satisfied and don't even notice. I can see this not being a problem in games like Pokemon, or Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. I've been playing ""The Touryst"", charming, relaxing, and a nice change of pace from what I usually play.

  The switch is already of my favorite consoles I’ve ever owned. As an adult-I’ve been surprised by how much I play it in handheld mode. It’s nice to be able to sneak in some gaming time here and there at work when there is some downtime. And I actually find myself playing it in handheld mode pretty often at home when I’m watching football on the weekends. I’m glad I waited until this model with the improved battery life came out. Sometimes, I don’t have to put it on the dock to charge for 5 or 6 days, assuming I’m playing 30 minutes here and there. I highly recommend this system.

  Almost everything about this console is perfect but the joy cons are flawed and Nintendo continues to ship the defective line as standard issue in switch and switch lite

  The game system we received is the newer one with better battery life. However, we've been disappointed with the joys cons. Both right joy cons in the included one and another set we bought would disconnect. If you read online there are all kinds of issues with the joy cons ever since they made the system. There are fewer problems since they updated them, however, the joy cons we received with this system are dated 2017, before they updated them. So, new game system, old joy cons. Seriously disappointed in this. Nintendo is in the process of setting up a warranty repair, but I shouldn't have to do this for a brand new system. The individual set we bought is going back and we purchased new ones in a local store that should theoretically be newer. To initiate the repair Nintendo asked about a hundred questions and 2 hours later the repair is accepted. Not a good setup, in my opinion.

  I’m not much of a video game person, but my boyfriend convinced me to buy the switch. I love it! I see why all the hype haha. Very easy to bring around too. I like how I get to play by myself, play with a group when I have guests over, or play overcook with my boo to get some laughters in.

  Im a pc gamer but i wanted a portable console to play my rpgs and single player games when im in bed.The convenience of the switch has helped me relax after many stressful sweaty fps, or competitive games i play.I havent owned a nintendo product since the launch of the ds light and im pretty happy with this product and the colorscheme.Im 26 and will never be to old to enjoy my console.

  My switch came in a lot earlier than I was expecting it to so I am over the moon with that! Not to mention that it came in perfect condition (I bought it in New condition but was feeling a little suspicious about it, not going to lie) Everything is working wonderfully right now so I really can't complain at all about the product itself. I definitely paid WAY too much for it (over $500 with tax) but if you're looking for a switch now in this quarantine time, you'll know there's a serious shortage of available consoles. All in all, definitely recommend buying if you're as impatient to get it as I was.

  Product came the first day of the projected arrival timeframe which was an exciting surprise! Packaging was USPS in a sturdy USPS box and taped very well with ""do not break seal"" type packaging tape which I really appreciated. Product came as advertised in Nintendo box, brand new, all main gaming system components and accessories still in plastic wrap and scratch resistant wrap. I'm very very happy with this purchase!! It was purchased as a gift to a family member as a way to help with the stress of all that's going on and I couldn't be happier with my order! Thank you!

  I bought this just to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and it didn't disappoint in the least! It's incredibly fun!One cool feature is that if you set up Parental Control using the free app, it will tell you how long you've played each day. Since I'm neither a parent nor do I need to be controlled, I disable restrictions and play-time limit so it doesn't actually interfere when I'm playing, but it is a bit sobering to see that yesterday I played for 6 hrs and 40 min.Also, if you set the play-time limit to 0 min everyday, the console will prompt you to disable Parental Control via a PIN. This could come in very handy if you have a sibling or roommate who likes to steal your Switch.I would also recommend getting a screen cover, either plastic or glass. I have a glass one that adheres like a second screen and haven't had any trouble yet, but then again I've only had it for 8 days and treat it very carefully.Overall, a great product, and worth every penny!

  I am very upset with this situation. I have purchased special editions of any number of consoles. If you buy the special edition of Destiny on PlayStation, you have the game. If you buy the special edition of Halo on Xbox, you have the game. If you buy the Wii Special Edition of Super Mario Bros 25th Anniversary, rest assured, you have the game. The first thing I saw when I opened the box was the message from Nintendo, ""GAME NOT INCLUDED"". But you do the publication and place it in a VERY SMALL font size and in a recondite place. VERY BAD AMAZON, VERY BAD.

  Buying a $300 item on amazon is terrifying! but this was our Christmas gift for my wife's parent and they loved it! it saved us time at the store and it was the perfect gift for them.- Package arrived on time- Box was well padded with those air bubblies- No fingerprints, scratches or damages anywhere on the packaging or the console- Everything was in place and we are happy customers

  This console is beautiful! I'm not a huge Animal Crossing fan but the new game did catch my eye even more when this Switch was announced. The pastel colors really work on the Switch, along with the design on the back. What really tempted me to buy this specific one was that it is the second version of the Switch. Which of course includes better battery life. I'm sure you've heard this all before, so I won't go any longer. It's a very pretty console and if you have your chance to get your hands on it for the normal market price. I'd suggest that you go for it!

  I got this for my 11-year-old daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it. Turns out my 5-year-old and husband enjoy playing on it as well! It's not a nice size screen and it's really cool that you can play it on the go or hook it up and play on the TV. You do need to make a Nintendo account, though, if you don't already have one in order to play on it, but overall set up was easy and didn't take too long. While the system was expensive it was definitely worth the investment! I do suggest getting a case to keep it in to keep it safe when not in use, though.

  This is my second Nintendo switch for my 2 kids. They get to play together at the same time either on TV or on the switch itself in seperate room. One thing that really makes me upset is the digital/download games. You can't download a game in one console (primary) and download the same game in the other console (different profile/account). Nintendo might have found a loophole to prevent losing more money by forcing people to buy second game for second console. Every game must be purchased two times for both Switches if they want to play together. Overall, Nintendo Switch console is worth it.

  Great product. Ordered it in the morning, 5 hours later was at my door. We live in beautiful times.Definitely recommend getting a Switch with colored joycons like this one, the black ones are dull and these Red/Blue ones retail for up to $80. Comes with everything you need except a carry case (which I would recommend instead of putting in your backpack lose) as well as picking up a good sized Micro SD card. I got like a 200gb one for $30-40 so I will never lose one of the tiny came cartridges.It's light weight and feels a little fragile, but not cheap feeling. Just wouldn't recommend dropping it like EVER. Anyway, great for all ages like 8-99yo. Bright screen, kick stand is a pain to open at first, but I've used that part like 2 times in 3 months.All n' all, would recommend!

  The product was in good condition. However, I purchased what appeared to be a new product. It was wasnt listed anywhere that I would be getting a used item. When my product arrived, I quickly realized that I was sold a used item because I didn’t have a pin to access any controls. The name of the previous family was listed on the product. I actually would t have minded a used Switch however I need to be able access the product. It’s very disappointing that I now have to wait over a month for another item.

  I had never played an Animal Crossing game before, but after seeing all of the trailers, I knew I had to have it.  I used NowInStock's website to get the red and blue for MSRP about 2 months ago, and have been having a blast with it ever since.  My boyfriend liked it so much he got one from GameStop about 3 weeks ago.  We could not be happier!

  Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Nintendo Switch has been in incredibly high demand. To have been able to purchase one successfully through a reliable seller (Techool (Seller Fulfilled Ships Fast)), is a blessing. It is pricer now but well worth it, especially while playing and staying at home. It arrived new and in perfect condition. Very happy and pleased with my purchase. Highly recommend!

  The product seems pretty good so far. Smaller than I thought as I had never actually seen the device, but the screen is clear, and the first game we bought (Mario karts) had fantastic clear graphics.Controllers are very small and awkward. We might get the more traditional controllers to replace the funny little joy cons.This offer came with a $30 credit that was not applied at delivery. Not sure why they couldn’t just discount it at purchase. So inevitably it went wrong and I needed to complain - hence dropping a few stars. Now I have a promotional credit that can be applied to eligible items but doesn’t appear on my account. So basically, don’t get too excited about the promo offer as it is super painful to get the money.

  The only way Nintendo will hear is is through reviews. Limit purchases 1-2 per household. These people buying up special editions and reselling for double the price HAS to stop. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. Let them sit on the consoles for as long as they possibly can. Nintendo make thousands more please - I beg you. Makes the people lose on their “investment” for once.

  Got this right before Christmas so our short family vacation during the holiday.  I use it at home and away.  We've got two extra controllers so the whole family can play together games like Mario Party, Mario Kart and etc.  I own several Nintendo game consoles like GameCube and Wii.  I think Nintendo’s switch is the most incredible system they’ve ever designed.

  Delivery was faster than expected (originally it was supposed to take over a month, it instead took ten days). However, I've known someone to recently purchase a Switch and it came 36 hours later and I know someone else that it took over 10 days and decided to just do curbside pickup with Best Buy instead.Otherwise, Switch was perfect.

  -1 Star because I hate price gougers, and I normally wouldn't ever support them for something like this, but I was behind the bus on the news about the release on this switch edition and decided if I was going to spend more on it I'd rather do it while it's still reasonable seeing as I was already spotting $700 ones which is outrageous. On another note the item came in pristine condition and as expected is very cute.

  The Switch is great and it can be enjoyed by everyone in the family. The only thing I did not like about it is the built-in stand it has on the back. It's very flimsy, keeps coming off and when in use it tends to fall off very easily, so you're probably going to have to look for an additional stand for it to play on some occasions.

  We bought this for our son's birthday and we haven't had it for even a year yet and it seems there is a hardware issue. We tried to use three different microSD cards (even the ones manufactured by Nintendo) to add more memory, but none of them worked. Formatting wasn't even an option. We kept getting error messages. I scoured the internet and used every troubleshooting option to no avail. We have only been able to use this Switch very minimally and is now being repaired by Nintendo since it is still under warranty. Also, because of a back up in repairs (due to Covid-19) we won't have it back for a couple months. Wish I could give it a raving review.

  Please ONLY buy from Seller Amazon or any other seller that sell at MSRP price and not over outrageous over +$300 price.  You are getting the same console nothing extra.

  The switch is the same price as PS4 and it is hard to get. However, in my view it is not as powerful as PS4. Thought it has its own advantage such as small, easy to travel, etc. But, due to the current situation, these are not the points I am looking for. Most of the time, I just play games in my house so I would epect a console more powerful to match the picture quality of my TV. But switch can only play some small games not 3A games.

  Nintendo exceeded my expectations with this console, the portability, the quality of the games, the graphics and everything else about it is so great that you wouldn't be able to find any of these things on any other console, I've only played a few hours on Nintendo switch's exclusive games like Mario Odyssey or breath of the wild but even by playing 2 hours with these games you can see how much effort and care went into these games, especially with Mario odyssey.I can't recommend this console enough.

  Happy with the product.  This is the revision with the improved battery life, which is a noticeable improvement.  It also has slightly higher brightness and truer color compared to the past model due to a display upgrade.  The only flaw to be aware of is the dock can scratch the screen, which makes a screen protector a must-have.

  I had been trying to find a switch ever since quarantine hit, but they were sold out everywhere. This one was about $400 after taxes and shipping, so it was overpriced $100 but it works great and was a lot easier than finding one on offer up. On top of that my delivery was super quick. I would have grave them 5 stars if it wasn't for the price gouge, regardless was worth it.

  I bought this unit to exercise with the help of my big screen TV; unfortunately it is not as easy to install as seen in the description.  I read the instruction but still could not install the station to my big screen TV; finally I am thinking to return it to the Seller. This assembly is made of thin plastic so I have to mount it next to the TV; I am afraid that it might break if accidental drop for some reasons. Its weight is quite light compared to other brands; game cartridges are not included and they cost about $50 each.  I am not happy with its performances so far and would not recommend to others.

  I love my switch. I was surprised about some of the games offered on the Nintendo store, I never realized the graphics were capable of some of those games (Skyrim, The Witcher 3..etc) battery life is great and it fits comfortably in my hand.

  This was a gift for my brother. Was happily surprised when I bought it on back order and it arrived a month before expected, in time for the holidays. So that was pretty awesome. Also it keeps him quiet (he's 20). Same price as everyone else.

  Pretty disappointed with the fact that I could find game sold separately anywhere in the sale s ad, so I assumed due to the huge price tag and the fact that animal crossing is all over the box that it came with it. Very unhappy! I feel purposely mislead.

  Outstanding special edition nintendo switch animal crossing. If you are a AC fan it is a must have! If you can get 2 and save one for later to sell as these are hard to find at this price!

   The Nintendo Switch is great at well, switching, no matter if it's on the bus or in the living room, the Nintendo Switch is a great console for the family or the dedicated gamer. This version, the V2, is a big upgrade over the original Switch and has a very noticeable extended battery life compared to the original Switch, with newer joycons included and a brighter LCD screen. Love it, use it everyday!

  Bought this and was unaware that it did not come with the game! Guess we were taken for a ride. Definitely price gouging. But lesson learned. Buyer be ware.

  While technologically inferior to the other 2 consoles of this gen, the Switch is hands down the most fun of them all. There are just a gazillion games available and the ability to seamlessly switch from docked mode to portable mode is just priceless. Nothing can beat being able to play your favorite games anywhere you want. Definitely a must buy.

  i had the older model and now that i switched to this one (no pun intended) i wouldn’t go back, back then i had to charge my old switch like 5 times a day under heavy gaming sessions, now i have to worry maybe once! great upgrade and heavily recommended if you mostly play 2d and indie games

  Usually, I am not one to make a big purchase like this since I am paranoid something will happen to it during delivery but the price was right so I went ahead and bought it. Everything came in perfect condition and the switch works great! I got this as a gift for someone and they loved it. Would definitely recommend purchasing!

  There’s a lot of things I like about the Switch, but at the same time, the limited number of interesting titles makes it a glorified dust collector... whenever I actually do remind myself to boot it up and play the titles I do have.

  We've only had them for a week, but one of the joy-cons is already malfunctioning. The right one - the joystick/cam will sometimes spin freely of its own accord. Annoying.

  I missed out on the launch and only now have the time to play one. Very happy there were still new mods out there! And this is from the South Asia region, so its an import, not a scalp. Switch is completely regional free too btw

  The Nintendo Switch is a great game system. The screen is nice and large making gameplay so much more enjoyable.

  I ordered this item, as the box indicates it is a US version of the switch. However, I received an international JP version from the seller. The fan is having issues now, and Nintendo will not support because I have a USA address. So I am up a creek. Would recommend looking elsewhere and making sure you get the USA version!

I just hope it lasts awhile!Thank you!

  Came perfectly and quickly. Great for kids and the whole family. Definitely pay attention to what kinds of controllers you need for multiplayer games, though. Some will work with just the ones that come with the console but some require another set!

  I really liked the product and it came in perfect condition but it was definitely well over it’s worth. The MSRP for the Nintendo switch is 300 dollars and it was sold for 448 dollars!!! If you can overlook that fact then it’s an amazing portable system and you’ll get a good use out of it.

  There is one thing that completely sells the Switch in my opinion: It seems every aspect(aside from one) of holding, picking up and down, docking, and generally ""living"" with the item has been thoroughly thought through. Playing while lying on your back is the only difficulty. 5/5

  
"

  specially under these stressful conditions we find ourselves in trying to stay home and somehow making money WITHOUT being able to work.  suddenly someone wants to buy a switch because they have the time but nintendo is gouging the product. not cool to take advantage of peoples situations.

  Do not buy any of it. The third party sellers are crazy. I love this edition, but I am definitely not going to pay double of its price.  Sellers, keep them until the coronavirus ends, and have fun.

  The Switch Lite may fall short in many areas, but this is the one to get. Its an improved original switch, with better battery life. However about 2 hours of battery life is the only difference, so if you find the old switch at a discount price that may be worth getting as well. This one has all the features and you can be sure all games will work with it, unlike the Switch Lite. The Switch Lite isn't worth getting IMO.The biggest pro IMO of the switch is the detachable joy-con's. I have never seen a handheld with detachable joy-con's before this one, and its a huge improvement. If you get sticky buttons, worn out buttons or have a problem with your joy-con's you can just swap them with a new set instead of having to replace the whole handheld. Because of Joy-con drift Nintendo is now fixing Joy-Con's for free so you can buy 2 sets of joy-con's and send one out while the other set is getting fixed. I play Pokemon and a lot of it which requires mashing the A button a lot so I used to find that the A button got worn down much faster than other buttons on previous systems. It was a very complicated procedure to fix this problem on previous handhelds, they didn't come apart too easily if you could get them apart at all. If you tinker or like taking things apart its much easier to take apart a single joy-con and replace a button pad rather than it is to take apart most of a handheld to reach the part that needs to be replaced. This increases the longevity of the system and makes it more durable without having to spend a lot of money on future systems.Its important that you look for the switch with the red box when buying, this is the newer model, the older model comes in a white box. Some places are still selling the older version for the same price as the new.

  joycons are BUILT TO BREAK. AC adapter is BUILT TO BREAK. Games are EXPENSIVE. Basically every piece will need to be replaced within 6 months. I am an adult who uses this a couple times a month and BOTH JOYCONS ARE BROKEN AND MY CHARGER IS BROKEN. It will not connect to TV anymore. NINTENDO IS DIRTY AND ALL THEY WANT IS ENDLESS MONEY.ALSO: During COVID 19 YOUR WARRANTY IS VOID, DO NOT FALL FOR IT

  so while i do love the switch and the games with it but with all this scallping and all that happening, i cant help but feel bad because apperently the sellers have such low brain cells that they cant comprehend that not everyone is going to a spare $600 or $700. id also like to metion that as soon as stock goes back into retail stores these third party sellers are going to go bankrupt. thank you for reading this review.

  I received this as a gift . The console shut down suddenly and would not charge or turn on for 3 weeks. Amazon wouldn't allow me to return it or exchange it because it was a gift. Nintendo only offers a repair kit but its not free. I finally got it to charge but after purchasing a game to play, the left joy con is broke. This all happened within 6 months of having it with little use! Now it's sitting, collecting dust. Do not gift it, and buy at your own risk 😡👎

  It was a gift for Valentines and luckily we didn’t wait a day longer or we wouldn’t have been able to return it. Upon opening it, the screen was literally so gross and dirty, we had to clean it before using it. Looked like a little kid was playing and got their food stuck to it. We hoped maybe that was all that was wrong, but nope, one of the joycons wouldn’t connect or hold a charge. Pretty upsetting if you ask me. Especially because it was given as a gift!

  Llegó en perfecto estado y en 15 minutos la tenía instalada y estaba lista para jugar. Además de la consola se incluyen los dos joycons, por supuesto, también los sujetadores para los joycons, el HDMI, el cable para la corriente y además un adaptador (o como se llame) para que los joycons se usen como un control tradicional al estilo XBOX. Estoy muy contento con la compra y recomiendo mucho la consola principalmente para aquellos que gustan de los juegos clásicos de Mario y también considero que es la mejor consola para niños y no tan niños.

  Now that I have this in my hand the whole system feels horribly designed. The games are great fun but having the controllers swap in and out different types of holders feels like it could break. All of it feels like if could break but it's designed like fisher price toy.Was well packaged and arrived undamaged. This was greatly appreciated.

  El empaque venía en muy buenas condiciones,  llegó bien sellado y completo el producto y antes de lo previsto.Al principio estaba indeciso entre el switch y el Ps4 pero la verdad no me arrepiento de haber escogido el switch.Nota: recomiendo compren junto con su consola una memoria micro sd de 128gb o mayor y un protector para su consola y un control extra si piensan jugar con amigos. Yo compré el pro controller y la verdad esta muy bueno, además es más cómodo que los Joy con.

  Encontré la Nintendo Switch en oferta y aproveché para adquirirla. Llegó en perfectas condiciones, sin rastros de maltrato, golpeaduras o rayones. Respecto al tiempo de batería es muy buena, tiene una duración lo bastante larga, jugando un aproximado de 3 horas parciales no he necesitado cargarla, sino hasta los dos o tres días siguientes, carga muy rápido también y en general de acuerdo al diseño es muy cómoda y se ve linda por el color gris. Adicional sugiero comprarle una mica de cristal y tener un paño para estarla limpiando, así como una funda protectora para tenerla con cuidados. La recomiendo ampliamente (:

  Recibí el paquete sellado y sin ningún problema. Pague por el envío y me sorprendió lo rápido que me enviaron el producto ya que lo pedí un lunes y me llegó el miércoles, siendo que la aplicación me marcaba el jueves. Estoy muy satisfecho con mi compra. El único detalle que observé fue que las correas que se acoplan a los joy-con quedan un poco desfasadas, no quedan exactamente a la misma altura de los mandos, pero no se nota demasiado. Fuera de eso no he tenido ningún problema con la consola hasta el momento.

  La consola es la misma, la compré porque la anterior versión duraba muy poco la batería. Si viajas mucho te servirá enormemente la duración de su batería. Me llego en perfectas condiciones. Muchas gracias Amazon.

  El paquete llegó antes del tiempo establecido y la caja en excelente estado, así como la consola, controles y demás accesorios, tenía mis dudas por ser una versión importada y batallar por aquello de la garantía, pero hasta el momento el funcionamiento ha sido excelente, mis hijos contentos y yo también porque fue un maravilloso regalo de Navidad a un muy buen precio.

  Horas y horas de diversión con esta consola. Siguiendo la filosofía de Nintendo, se necesitan comprar muchos accesorios para sacarle todo el provecho y protegerla, ya que es algo frágil.

  Sin problemas con la entrega. Bien empaquetado. Y el producto, simplemente genial. Es una consola muy versátil. Adquirí Mario Kart 8 Deluxe y se ve muy bien tanto en TV como portátil. Recomendada consola, aunque sus juegos son muy caros, pero buscando buenas ofertas o seminuevos, vale mucho la pena.

  (VENDIDO Y ENVIADO POR AMAZON MEXICO) Embalaje perfecto, no tuve ningún problema con ello, todo sellado, la consola está en perfectas condiciones, tengo al menos ya con esta 3 semanas de haber recibido el producto y todo sin problemas, con respecto a la consola te recomiendo que tengas contemplados de antemano la mica de cristal templado y el protector de uso rudo (para los peques xd)

  Okay, so overall, the product is amazing. It has many fun games and stuff, but i have a few problems with it. First: it doesnt have thet much sapce. 25 GB might seem like alot, but good games that you can play offline like smash bros takes up a lot of space.

Muy buena compra, justo  lo que esperaba.

  Estaba temeroso de comprar algo caro por Amazon pero la verdad el precio era el más bajo. Me llegó muy bien cuidado el empaque y muy rápido. Después de más de 6 meses de uso, estoy muy contento con mi nintendo Switch.

  Por si no saben, este switch comparado con el de la caja normal tiene un mejor procesador, que hace que el consumo de energia sea mas eficiente y alargue la vida de la pila por masomenos 2 hrs. Es muy buena compra.
